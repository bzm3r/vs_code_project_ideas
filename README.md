####"I wish I had time...", or "each one a rabbit hole"

Just a list of things that come to mind, so that once they are written down, they may be safely forgotten forever:

* snippet for quickly filling out the consts of a [bitflags](https://docs.rs/bitflags/latest/bitflags/) struct with appropriate values: e.g. `1 << 0;` for the first, `1 << 1` for the next, and so on.

* auto-shortcut-generator:
  * evaluate which keys are most easily reached by user on existing setup
  * suggest available shortcut completions based on current key chords
  * when user completes an action that has a keyboard shortcut, remind them of it
  * suggest possible keyboard shortcuts for a new action, based on action name and currently occupied keyboard shortcuts
